<h3> Hi there </h3>

Currently building cool things at TikTok! 
I currently work in the iOS Arch & Infra team, focused on the client product architecture direction. We take care of the whole loop of building the arsenal, measuring, and doing the governance of all tools used by TikTok RDs in the 11+ million lines of code codebase, which includes the core architecture of the project, Swift evolution and governance, AI efficiency, and hundreds of libraries. The other directions of my team take care of Xcode, build system infrastructure, git, automations, and much more.
